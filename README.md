### Important Notes:
# //Props: 
# Task 1
System for passing data from parent to child component.
Goal is to customize or configure a child component.
Here we have two stages:
1) we provide information from parent to child,
Example: in index.js we have 
```html <CommentDetails author="sam"/> ```
Here we have name of prop author with value sam.
2) then child consumes or make use of it.
In CommentDetail commponent we pass props and added ```html {props.author} ``` which consumes passed data
//Goal of components is to show some content to the user or react to user interaction.
Output:

![Task one](https://github.com/PreetDP/rcomponents/blob/main/OutputImages/Taskone.png?raw=true "Task one")

# Task 2:
Here, we will add the ApprovalCard and two buttons approve and reject. Show all the comments and users on approval card. Add all the main content of task one on the ApprvalCard.

This task is to show component resuability:
First we create ApprovalCard component with with two buttons.
Then we pass CommentDeatil component in AprrovalCard tag in index.js
Finally we add props to AprrovalCard.js and reference {props.children} .
We can also add plain text or html inside ApprovalCard component tag in index.js to ensure that it can be reuse whereever we want.
OutPut :

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
